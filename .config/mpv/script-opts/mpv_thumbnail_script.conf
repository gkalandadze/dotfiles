# The thumbnail cache directory.
# On Windows this defaults to %TEMP%\mpv_thumbs_cache,
# and on other platforms to /tmp/mpv_thumbs_cache.
# The directory will be created automatically, but must be writeable!
# Use absolute paths, and take note that environment variables like %TEMP% are unsupported (despite the default)!
cache_directory=/home/gkala/.cache/mpv_thumbnails_cache

# Whether to generate thumbnails automatically on video load, without a keypress
# Defaults to yes
autogenerate=yes

# Only automatically thumbnail videos shorter than this (in seconds)
# You will have to press T (or your own keybind) to enable the thumbnail previews
# Set to 0 to disable the check, ie. thumbnail videos no matter how long they are.
# Defaults to 3600 (one hour)
autogenerate_max_duration=5400

# The thumbnail count target
# (Setting this to 150 will result in a thumbnail every ~10 seconds for a 25 minute video)
thumbnail_count=300

# The above target count will be adjusted by the minimum and
# maximum time difference between thumbnails.
# The thumbnail_count will be used to calculate a target separation,
# and min/max_delta will be used to constrict it.

# In other words, thumbnails will be:
# - at least min_delta seconds apart (limiting the amount)
# - at most max_delta seconds apart (raising the amount if needed)
# Defaults to 5 and 90, values are seconds
min_delta=5
max_delta=90
# 120 seconds aka 2 minutes will add more thumbnails only when the video is over 5 hours long!


# Allow thumbnailing network paths (naive check for "://")
# Defaults to no
thumbnail_network=yes
# Override thumbnail count, min/max delta, as above
remote_thumbnail_count=60
remote_min_delta=15
remote_max_delta=120
