# The thumbnail count target
# (This will result in a thumbnail every ~10 seconds for a 25 minute video)
thumbnail_count=150

# The above target count will be adjusted by the minimum and
# maximum time difference between thumbnails.
# The thumbnail_count will be used to calculate a target separation,
# and min/max_delta will be used to constrict it.

# In other words, thumbnails will be:
# - at least min_delta seconds apart (limiting the amount)
# - at most max_delta seconds apart (raising the amount if needed)
# Defaults to 5 and 90, values are seconds
min_delta=5
max_delta=90
# 120 seconds aka 2 minutes will add more thumbnails only when the video is over 5 hours long!


# Allow thumbnailing network paths (naive check for "://")
# Defaults to no
thumbnail_network=yes
# Override thumbnail count, min/max delta, as above
remote_thumbnail_count=60
remote_min_delta=15
